    <p><strong>The Onion Train</strong> was built of need.</p>
    <p>
      Tickets for the Intercity Premium trains are fucking expensive. The only way to enjoy your
      ride and not ruin yourself financially is to buy a ticket 30 days before the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      This app will remind you to stay late on that day as you need to buy the discounted tickets
      immediately after they become available, before they ran out.
