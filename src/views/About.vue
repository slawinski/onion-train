    <p><strong>The Onion Train</strong> was built of need.</p>
    <p>
      Tickets for Intercity Premium trains are fucking expensive. The only way to enjoy your ride
      and not ruin yourself financially is to buy a ticket 30 days before the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      This app will remind you to stay late on that day as you need to buy the tickets immediately
      after they become available, before the discounted ones ran out.
