    <h3>About this app:</h3>
    <p><strong>The Onion Train</strong> was created out of actual need.</p>
    <p>
      Tickets for Express Intercity Premium trains are crazy expensive. The only way not to ruin
      your yourself financially is to buy a ticket 30 days before the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      This app will remind you to stay late on that date as you need to buy the tickets immediately
      after they become available, before the discounted ones ran out.
